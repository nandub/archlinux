/**
 * User-specific BTSync configuration.
 *
 * Helps to set ownership to someone other than root for files that are copied
 * with btsync. Copy this file to ~/.btsync/settings.json for the user you wish
 * to configure btsync as:
 *
 *   mkdir -p ~/.btsync
 *   cp /etc/btsync/btsync@.json ~/.btsync/settings.json
 *
 * Replace user-specific references with the appropriate information, including
 * the following settings:
 *
 * - storage_path
 * - pid_file
 * - webui.listen
 * - webui.login
 * - webui.password
 *
 * Then start btsync:
 *
 *   systemctl start btsync@user
 *
 * where `user` is your username.
